# Git Flow Guidelines

This repository follows the standard **Git Flow** branching model:

## Main Branches
- **`main`**: Contains production-ready code. Direct commits to `main` are strictly prohibited.
- **`develop`**: Primary integration branch for ongoing development. All feature branches merge here after code review.

## Supporting Branches
- **Feature Branches** (`feature/<feature-name>`):
  - Created from: `develop`
  - Merged into: `develop`
  - Naming: `feature/short-description` (e.g., `feature/survey-form-validation`)
- **Release Branches** (`release/<version>`):
  - Created from: `develop`
  - Merged into: `main` and `develop`
  - Naming: `release/vX.Y.Z`
- **Hotfix Branches** (`hotfix/<issue-name>`):
  - Created from: `main`
  - Merged into: `main` and `develop`
  - Naming: `hotfix/short-description`
- **Bugfix Branches** (`bugfix/<issue-name>`):
  - Created from: `develop`
  - Merged into: `develop`
  - Naming: `bugfix/short-description`

## Commit & Pull Request Standards
- Keep commits atomic and focused.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., `feat(survey): add real-time form validation`).
- Always open Pull Requests targeting `develop` for features and bugfixes.

## Deployment Guidelines
- **NEVER deploy to Vercel directly**: Do not run manual deployment commands like `vercel` or `vercel --prod` via CLI.
- **Automated Webhook Deployments**: Always let the GitHub webhook trigger Vercel deployments automatically upon pushing commits to `main` (production) and `dev` / PRs (preview).
